# noobonicplague

This was made as an effort to preserve the gamemode code of noobonicplague for educational purposes for those who want to use or learn from it. I did not write any of this, but was uploaded with permission of Cobra, one of Noobonic Plagues lead administrators. I cannot explain how any of this code works, and 95% of it was written by Jeezy.

Feel free to use this for whatever purpose you see fit.
